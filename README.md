The repository represents the most integrall and most beautiful solution of the [task](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/task-description.pdf) by [russian AAA Media Corporation Rambler&Co](https://ramblergroup.com/). The jot of task's description looks like: **"Queue Managment System akin with McDonalds orders giving or with Bank client's handling process. First, an user inquires for an unique token, then using this token obtains the required service."** The full description of the task represented [below](#full-tasks-description).

## Full Task's Description
If be more accurate I translate the task from [task-description.pdf](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/task-description.pdf) over here.


>It is necessary to implement a web service of the queue management system for viewing kitties using aiohttp along the REST API.
The service provides two resources:
>- Get a token
>- Get a kitty
>
>An user, firstly, makes a GET request and gets his number in the queue. Next step, using this number, he makes a POST request to the second resource.
>* If his turn came up, then he gets a picture of a kitty.
>* If his turn did not fit, then a response is returned with a proposal to repeat request later.
>* If an user is a cheater and tries to get a kitty by a nonexistent number, then you need to deal with it with the full severity of the HTTP protocol.
>* If you took a number, but did not come for the kitty, the rest should not wait eternity. 
>
>The result should be an sdist archive suitable for installation in a virtual environment, as well as instructions in README with a description of how the service
to use.
>
>Itâ€™s not necessary for execution, but as a pros for you will be counted: a working docker file, deployment service; good code coverage with tests; web page for viewing a cat (that is, a client for a written service).

So, it's been the full description of the task.

## Pre-Installation requirements
It depends on method how you will install the application.
* The easiest way is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), therefore just install the Docker and follow [ahead](#instalation-using-docker).
* The second option is to use setup.py. In this purpose merely install the [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Also we shall to have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
* The third way is prettiy akin with second one, hence you also need the [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Installation
The common steps for all 3 cases are:

>\> git clone https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System.git

>\> cd Cats_Queue_Management_System
### Instalation using Docker
It's important to check configuration. If you going to use docker, I created the configuration specified for docker. There is the definition in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/Dockerfile) which copies the configuration from [config_for_docker.yaml](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/config_for_docker.yaml) to [basic configuration file](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/application/config.yaml):
```docker
RUN cat ./config_for_docker.yaml > ./application/config.yaml
```
Modify [config_for_docker.yaml](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/config_for_docker.yaml) as you want so. However, if you wish to launch the application set *run_type* as **debug** or **release**. In purpose to familiarize to configuration file [follow ahead](#configuration-file).
Launch the docker. It depends on OS.

**Linux**

>\> sudo service docker start

**Windows**

Press on *Docker Desktop* then wait until the whale's icon become stable.

Then build the docker container using this command:
>\> docker-compose up application

Then, whereas the docker build will has freezed merely follow the link.
> http:\\\localhost:8080 

### Instalation using setuptools
First, install virtual enviroment.
>\> pip install virtualenv

Then sets virtual enviroment up:
>\> python3 -m venv env

The start the enviroment up:
**Linux**
>\> source env/bin/activate

**Windows**
>\> cd env/Scripts
>
>\> activate
>
>\> cd ../..

Then you should install required packages.
>\> pip install -r requirements.txt

The next step is building the app:
**Note**: Please do not use the *python3 setup.py install*. I do not fucking aware why it doesn't work.
>\> python3 setup.py develop

Before the application starting you should create the database. For this use the command below:
>\> createdb -U postgres CatsQMS

Then initializing the [table](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/application/sources/database/init.sql)
>\> psql -U postgres -d CatsQMS -f application/sources/database/init.sql

**Note:** if you don't want to modify the [config.yaml](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/application/config.yaml) - set the password of PostgreSQL as **12345qwerty**, because this one I used.

Launch the application:
1. --test - test-mode, launches the tests for the application.
2. --debug - debug-mode, launches the application with actions's logging.
3. --release - release-mode, does the same as the debug-mode but without logging.
>\> start_app --debug

Follow the link:
> http:\\\localhost:8080 

### Installation using Pipfile
The installation is pretty similar with previous one.
First:
>\> pip install pipenv

Then instead of `python -m venv env` just seize:
>\> pipenv shell

As soon as you type it, virtual enviroment will already activated. 
Then install required packages:
>\> pipenv install --dev

Before the application starting you should create the database. For this purpose use the command below:
>\> createdb -U postgres CatsQMS

Then initializing the [table](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/application/sources/database/init.sql)
>\> psql -U postgres -d CatsQMS -f application/sources/database/init.sql

Then start the application:
>\> python3 application/entry.py --debug

Follow the link:
> http:\\\localhost:8080 

## Advanced configuration
A little bit regard the configuration of the application.
### Configuration File
This file placed at [application-dir](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/tree/master/application). Let's take it apart:
```yaml
database_config:
  host: localhost
  user: postgres
  password: 12345qwerty
  port: 5432
  database: CatsQMS

run_type: debug
```
- *database_config* - it's the configuration for your database. The config could be represented in two ways. First one is the *uri link*. In the [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/libpq-connect.html#AEN39692) it's clearly described. The second one is the list of metadata, as so I did.
  - *host* - the host where database is placed. Default is the localhost.
  - *user* - the user of database. Default user is *postgres*.
  - *password* - the password you set when you were installing PostgreSQL.
  - *port* - listening port for connection between database and application. Default is *5432*.
  - *database* - the name of database to which you want to connect.

For obtaining more information about database configuration's parameters - just follow the [link](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/api/index.html#connection)

- *run_type* - apparently it is the type which defines some changes of application's demeanor.
  - *test* - the service doesn't launch, however tests for the entire application do.
  - *debug* - application launches with loggin of users's actions.
  - *release* - virtually the same as the debug except the logging.

**Configuration file for Docker**
My advice for you: DO NOT MODIFY FIELDS EXCEPT *run_type*.
The configuration is pretty akin with main config, except *database_config*:*host*. In the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) you can emphasize the string, where database service named as *db*. The Docker writes the name of the db-service into the `etc/hosts` as *ip-psqlserver: db*. The *run_type* works likelihood as in the basic [config.yaml](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/application/config.yaml)
```yaml
services: 
    db:
        image: postgres
        volumes: 
            - ./application/sources/database/:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
        environment:
            - POSTGRES_DB=CatsQMS
            - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=12345qwerty
```
### Cmd/Terminal parameters
In the [entry.py](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Cats_Queue_Management_System/blob/master/application/entry.py) defined the parser which parses command line arguments:
```python
parser.add_argument('--host', help="Host to listen", default='0.0.0.0')
parser.add_argument('--port', help="Port to accept connection", default=8080)
parser.add_argument('-c', '--config', type=argparse.FileType('r'), help="Path to configuration file")
parser.add_argument('--test', help="The run-type sets as test", action='store_true')
parser.add_argument('--debug', help="The run-type sets as debug", action='store_true')
parser.add_argument('--release', help="The run-type sets as release", action='store_true')
```
Let's scuttle across them:
* *--host* - the host for the application, default is 0.0.0.0. The example: `start_app --host 127.0.0.1`
* *--port* - the port to accept connection. default is 8080. The example: `start_app --port 6080`
* *--config* - the custom config file, which adding up to the basick config file. The example: `start_app --config <path to your custom config>`
* *--test* - the application will have launched in the test-mode. The example: `start_app --test`
* *--debug* - the application will have launched in the debug-mode. The example: `start_app --debug`
* *--release* - the application will have launched in the debug-mode. The example: `start_app --release`
